This project is a simulation of a tournament based on the classic game theory concept, the Prisoner's Dilemma. In this project, we implement and pit various strategies against each other in a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma tournament to observe their performance and understand the dynamics of cooperation and competition.

**Why the Prisoner's Dilemma?**

The Prisoner's Dilemma is a foundational concept in game theory that explores why cooperation can be difficult to achieve even when it is mutually beneficial.  Simulating tournaments of different strategies provides insights into:

*   **Strategic Thinking:** How different strategies perform in competitive scenarios.
*   **Evolution of Cooperation:**  Understanding conditions under which cooperation can emerge and be sustained.
*   **Algorithmic Implementation:**  Demonstrating the ability to translate abstract strategies into working code.

This project provides a practical and engaging way to explore these concepts through code.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following skills, valuable for software development and related roles:

*   **Algorithm Implementation:**  Successfully translating game theory strategies (like Tit for Tat, Jos, etc.) into functional code.
*   **Simulation Design:**  Designing and implementing a robust simulation environment to model the Prisoner's Dilemma tournament.
*   **Unit Testing:**  Writing comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness of strategy implementations and game logic.
*   **Project Structure and Organization:**  Demonstrating good software engineering practices through a well-organized project structure, modular code, and clear separation of concerns.
*   **Language Proficiency:**  Proficiency in [**Choose: Python or Go**] (or both, if you implement in both), including language-specific features and best practices.
*   **Documentation:**  Creating clear and comprehensive documentation to explain the project, its usage, and the underlying concepts.
*   **Version Control (Git):**  Utilizing Git for version control and collaboration (demonstrated by the GitHub repository itself).
*   **Problem Solving:**  Applying computational thinking to model and analyze a complex problem from game theory.
